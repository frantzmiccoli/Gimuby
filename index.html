                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                    <p>
                        Genetic algorithms are loved for their flexibility and easiness
                        of understanding. The island model is initially a way to
                        distribute genetic algorithm, but also can provide better
                        results than genetic algorithm even if distribution of
                        computations is not considered
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Gimuby is providing genetic algorithms and island model as
                        a Ruby library. Few technical choice are imposed to the end user
                        and most execution parameters can be easily controlled like
                        mutation strategy, selection strategy, scaling, sharing,
                        reproduction strategy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Gimuby doesn't use multiprocessing of any kind, thus its
                        island models are not distributed in any sense.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div id="why" class="content-block">
                    <h2>Why using Gimuby</h2>

                    <h3>Easy problems</h3>

                    <p>
                        Most problems studied at school are of a special kind that make
                        them computationnaly easy to solve optimally. You find the right
                        formula for your model and then you compute what input optimizes
                        your system.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Hard problems</h3>

                    <p>
                        (Un)fortunately some problem are harder, and in thus, for some
                        weirdos, more interesting. One of the most known examples is the
                        Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). A salesman needs to go in
                        twenty different cities, what order will lead to the shortest
                        path? To date, no quick way is known about how to find the
                        best order without testing every possibilities (about a billion
                        billions).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Heuristics</h3>

                    <p>
                        Usually systems can work with with not the best but some
                        acceptable solution, because in the end, salesmen are outside,
                        working. Approximative and empirical method called heuristics
                        are used to pragmatically tackle those problems.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Metaheuristics</h3>

                    <p>
                        Genetic algorithms and the island model belong to a kind of
                        heuristic called metaheuristics. They are providing a generic
                        tool to solve hard problems.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Is your problem hard?</h3>

                    <p>
                        The first thing you must know is the nature of your problem. If
                        you don't know what you are doing and have a doubt about your
                        problem, there's a 50% probability that you may are using Gimuby
                        to solve a problem that doesn't need metaheuristics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The risk is to spend development time and computational time to
                        find a half good solution, when your problem could be solved
                        optimally with less resources. Talk with operational research
                        experts if this point seems critical to your business.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Use Gimuby</h3>

                    <p>
                        If you understand all the above, you may want to use Ruby to
                        solve your problem. So far Gimuby seems to provide the most
                        advanced genetic algorithms implementation available on the
                        language for the following reasons:

                        <li>Highly customisable.</li>
                        <li>
                            Optimized genetic algorithm available (around the settings
                            of default parameters).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <div id="installation" class="content-block">
                    <h2>Installation</h2>

                    <p>
                        Gimuby is available for Ruby 1.8.7, it could be easily
                        ported to newer versions but the work is not done yet.
                    </p>

                    <div class="code">
                        <pre>gem install gimuby</pre>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div id="basic-usage" class="content-block">
                    <h2>Basic usage</h2>

                    <p>
                        Gimuby will always try to minimize the fitness returned of its
                        individuals. If you want to maximize a function, you will have
                        to learn the subtle usage of the "-" symbol.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The simplest usage of Gimuby that can be be made is the
                        optimization of mathematical function with only one property:
                        the input variables are float that belong to the same interval.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In that case you just need to implement your function, wrap it
                        inside a Solution class and run an algorithm with Gimuby.
                    </p>

                        The basic usage hides complexity because it is using an edge case
                        where solutions mutation, check and reproduction strategies can
                        be easily inferred.

                    <p>
                       Most of those strategies can be reused depending on the problem
                       you are trying to tackle.

                        Gimuby has been designed to enable highly customisable behaviors.

                        Many elements can be modified by setting what are called

                            ReplaceStrategy (genetic algorithms related): replace
                            individuals to make the new generation of a population
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CheckStrategy (solution related): checks that an individual
                            is correct.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MutationStrategy (solution related): mutates an individual
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            NewGenerationStrategy (solution related): produces new
                            individuals from two parents
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Those strategies are here to make code factorisation possible
                        among problems. There are a few problems that are implemented
                        inside Gimuby that uses those factorisation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finer customisation can be achieved by overriding Population and
                        Archipelago classes but this would cancel the usage of the
                        factory.

                    <p>
                        An example performs a manual instantiation of the optimizers.
                        It's the best place to start if you want to customize these
                        aspects.
